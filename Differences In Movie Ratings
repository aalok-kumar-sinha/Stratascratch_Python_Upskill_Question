\\
Calculate the average lifetime rating and rating from the movie with second biggest id across all actors and all films they had acted in. Remove null ratings from the calculation.
Role type is "Normal Acting". Output a list of actors, their average lifetime rating, rating from the film with the second biggest id (use id column),
and the absolute difference between the two ratings.
